# Ecosnap AI

Ecosnap AI is a mobile application designed to help users dispose of waste responsibly. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI), the app classifies waste and suggests eco-friendly disposal or recycling methods. The app also helps users locate nearby recycling centers using Google Maps API.

## Problem

Many people struggle to dispose of waste correctly due to a lack of awareness about recycling practices and waste management. As a result, large amounts of waste end up in landfills, causing harm to the environment.

## Solution

Ecosnap AI solves this problem by:

- Using AI-powered image classification (via **Teachable Machine**) to identify different types of waste (plastics, paper, metals, organic, etc.).
- Providing eco-friendly suggestions for disposal or recycling.
- Using the **Google Maps API** to locate nearby recycling centers for easy access.

## Features

- **Waste Classification:** Users can take a picture of the waste, and the app will automatically classify it and suggest proper disposal methods.
- **Recycling Center Locator:** The app uses Google Maps to display nearby recycling centers for easy disposal.
- **Eco-Friendly Suggestions:** After identifying the waste, the app provides environmentally conscious disposal or recycling options.

## Tech Stack
